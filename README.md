# Covid-19 Analysis

### INTRODUCTION

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human life worldwide and presents an
unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems and the world economy.
The domain that we have chosen for our project is Data Analysis and under that our topic is
‘COVID-19 Data Analysis and Prediction’ as it is currently the most crucial and the most
relevant subject of discussion worldwide. The pandemic has been affecting all of our lives for
over a year now, but at the same time, it has given us, data enthusiasts, an opportunity to work
with a large amount of actual, real-time data, analyse it and draw some interesting
conclusions.

### OBJECTIVE
Our goal through this project is to use the data in a practical setting, perform some
manipulations on the data and gain insights from it. We have created interactive dashboards
tracking the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries – by country, based on the publicly
available COVID-19 dataset provided by Johns Hopkins University and another dashboard
tracking the cases in India, state-wise.
